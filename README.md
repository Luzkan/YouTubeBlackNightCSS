# YouTube Black Night CSS
YouTube Black Night CSS - Dark Themed Custom CSS for YT by Luzkan

**Turn on "Dark Mode"** (huh!) **on YouTube while using this theme.**

## About
I couldn't find any theme that fits my needs on a site that I spend not reasonable time on. 
So I looked up a lot of them and created my own. 
No eye-catching useless fancy stuff - it's pure gray-black with easy to read color for text.
Additionally removed all youtubes unnecessery ui so now it's minimalistic and simple.
To not make it all-in monochrome - there's small accent included (which is configurable too!)

## Features
 * Midnight Black Style (theme)
 * Blue Accents
    * On YouTube logo
    * Current tab
    * Progress Bars
    * Watched Bar
    * and some more
 * Easy searchbox
 * Custom scrollbar (matching Dark Google Theme for Chrome)
 * Minimalistic Design

### Future
Well, if you find any bug - please tell me and I'll try to fix it asap.
If you do see some neat ideas that could be implemented then feel free to inform me about it as well! :3
