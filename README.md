# YouTube Black Night CSS
YouTube Black Night CSS - Dark Themed Custom CSS for YT by Luzkan

**Turn on "Dark Mode"** (huh!) **on YouTube while using this theme.**

## About
I couldn't find any theme that suits my needs for YouTube, a site that I spend an unreasonable time on.
I looked up a lot of them, but in the end decided to create to my own.
No eye-catching useless fancy stuff - it's mostly gray and black and easy to read.
Additionally removed all YouTube's unnecessery UI so now it's minimalistic and simple.
In order to avoid a monochrome design, I've included a small accent/color accent (which is configurable).


## Features
 * Midnight Black Style (theme)
 * Blue Accents
    * YouTube logo
    * Current tab
    * Progress Bars
    * Watched Bar
    * and more
 * Easy searchbox
 * Custom scrollbar (matching Dark Google Theme for Chrome)
 * Minimalistic Design

## Screenshots
*As of 1.0 Version [30.03.2019]*

### Future
My main goal is to release a whole plugin for Chrome (and other browsers if possible) that adds all the features I'm missing on YouTube right now. However, that won't come quickly as I would like, because of the time consumed by studies and my other side projects.
 As soon as I learn JavaScript, it will become my first project.

Nevertheless, we live in the present, so here's a request from me: if you find any bugs, please contact me and I'll try to fix it ASAP.
If you have ideas or feature requests that could be implemented, feel free to contact me about them as well.
